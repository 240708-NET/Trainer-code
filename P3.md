# Our fourth project, P3 - Web Application with Frontend, API backend, and SQL Database

## Project Requirements (Minimum Viable Product)
### Application Architecture
- Your code must be pushed to a project git repo on the cohort organization
- Your application must build and run
- Your application components must be loosely coupled, and exemplify a Service Oriented Architecture

### SQL Database
- Your database must use MS SQL Server
- Your database must be hosted on Azure
- Your database should be in 3rd normal form
- Your database should include at least one many-to-many relationship
- Your database should be set up through an Entity Framework "Code-First" migration

### API
- Your API must be written in C# for .NET
- Your API must use the ASP.NET framework
- Your API must exemplify the principles of REST
- Your API must implement the Repository pattern for data persistance (multiple namespaces, interface)
- Your API must implement SQL Server and Entity Framework Core to provide data persistance
- Your API should fulfill all common CRUD functions
- Your API should include proper exception handling
- Your API should include validation for any data being received (both FE and DB directions!)
- Your API should include at least 70% unit test coverage

### Frontend
- Your frontend must interact with your API for data persistence with HTTP requests
- Your frontend must use the React library. 
    - Your frontend must include at least three components, with at least one nested component. (At least one parent-child relationship, and at least one other unrelated component).
        - Your components should include at least one component that implements `useState`.
        - Your components should include at least one component with props.
        - Your components should include at least one component that implements the `Context` hook.
- Your frontend __may__ be built on the Node.js or Next.js frameworks.

### DevOps
- For every application architectural component (front end/backend), have a docker image that will allow it to be containerized.
- Create a docker compose file to expedite local startup

## Non-Functional Requiremnts
- Your project team should select a Team Lead to organize the development team efforts
- Your project should include a Project Description document which details:
    - a description of the project
    - at least ten user stories for your applicaton.
    - a wireframe diagram of the UI
    - an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) of the Database
    - unit test coverage reporting
    - API endpoint documentation
- Your project team should follow any relevant Agile ceremonies:
    - Conduct a daily stand-up meeting
        - meeting notes should be kept to record development progress
    - Decide on your sprint length(s), and hold ceremonies accordingly

## Project Presentation
- Project presentation will be done on Thursday 8/29
- You should demo the application functionality by completing the planned user stories
- Your presentation should be about 15-20 min.
    - Demo
    - Team introductions
    - Lessons Learned
    - QA
