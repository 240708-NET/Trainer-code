## Version Control Systems

### What is the VCS?

It is software that helps manage changes to source code, documents, or any any set of files over time.

#### Key aspects and benefits:
- Tracking changes
- Versioning
- Collaboration
- Back up and recovery
## Centralized and Desentrilized VCS

**Centralized** - central signle repo that stores all version all files

**Decentralized / Distributed** - each dev

## GIT

### Three States
- Modified (changed a file, not commited)
- Staged (marked a modifed file in its current version)
- Commited (data is safely stored in local database)

### Three Main Sections of a Git project
