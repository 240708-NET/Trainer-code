## Our Goal
To get you ready to interview and work as professional software engineers.

## Your Goal
Learn as much as you can, with the expectations that you will be asked to use these technology at your interview and project.

## Expectations
- Attendance/timeliness: Please email trainers if you have to miss a day or part of the day for appointments/emergencies, etc.
- Transparent Communication: We can't help you if you don't tell us.
- Safe Learning Environment: We are all here to learn. Effective learning does not take place without trust and vulnerability. This means no bullying, hate speech, discrimination, but also being kind to others and treating each other with respect.  
- Cameras are Always appreciated! Camera fatigue is real. But humans depend a lot on non-verbal communication and this helps us to tell quickly how you're feeling/if you are understanding the material. Also it makes us feel more connected!

## Advices from Us
We've seen hundreds of associates go through this process. Here are some advices to keep in mind as we embark on this journey.
- Time management and effective prioritizing is very important. If you don't know how, learn now
- Your technical skills are only as good as your soft skills. If you can't show other people how good you are, your skills won't be appreciated. The work will speak for itself only goes so far.
- Work together, collaborate, teach and bring each other up. It will only make you a better developer.
- Get things working First, and then make it better. Don't get sucked into optimizing too early.
- Take your time and read through things carefully. This applies to your code, error messages, documentations, instructions, stack overflow articles.
